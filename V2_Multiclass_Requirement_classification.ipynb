    "LSTM in its core, preserves information from inputs that has already passed through it using the hidden state. Unidirectional LSTM only preserves information of the past because the only inputs it has seen are from the past. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Using **bidirectional** LSTM will run your inputs in two ways, one from past to future and one from future to past and what differs this approach from unidirectional is that in the LSTM that runs backwards you preserve information from the future and using the two hidden states combined you are able in any point in time to preserve information from both past and future.\n",

    "What they are suited for is a very complicated question but BiLSTMs show very good results as they can understand context better. "
